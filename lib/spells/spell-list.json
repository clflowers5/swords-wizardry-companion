      "The caster creates a mental contact with the planes, forces, powers, and geometries of the beyond, in order to gain affirmative or negative answers to the questions he contemplates. The spell’s effects depend upon how deeply into the caster quests into the various planes of existence. The caster must decide how “far” into the planes of existence he wishes to make contact. The number of planes in “depth” that he chooses will affect the number of yes or no questions he can ask, the chance that the knowledge is available at that level, the chance of receiving a wrong answer, and the chance that he will become temporarily insane from the experience. Temporary insanity lasts for as many weeks as the “number” of the plane where the caster’s sanity failed (or was deliberately removed)."

Note that this spell is not by any means the only way in which groups of druids might exercise control over weather conditions using holy places or acting together in mystic rituals. It is simply the manner by which a lone (but powerful) Druid can summon forth weather conditions using no ritual beyond mere spell casting."
